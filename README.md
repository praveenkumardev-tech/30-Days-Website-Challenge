# 30 Days Website Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my **#30DaysWebsiteChallenge** — a self-imposed challenge to build 30 small but meaningful web apps in 30 days. Each day focuses on improving frontend skills, real-world logic, and UI design.

## ✅ Day 1: DM Delay Button App

**Summary:**  
A smart messaging feature that delays sending your DM, giving users a short window to cancel the message — like an "Undo Send" option.

**UI Features:**
- Message input box
- Delay time selector (10s / 30s / 60s)
- “Send” button that turns into “Cancel” before timeout
- Toast message after sending

**Tech Used:**
- React + Vite (TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS
- ShadCN UI

**Concepts Practiced:**
- `setTimeout()` and `clearTimeout()` for async control
- `useState` for managing message, timer, delay
- Conditional rendering
- Real-world thinking: cancel queues, buffers

**Tech Used:**
